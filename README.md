Challenges:
- 405 Error <br />
The 405 Method Not Allowed error occurs between a client and a server. This message indicates that the web server has recognized a request from a web browser to access the website but rejects the specific HTTP method. Since the web browser cannot access the requested page, it will show an error message instead.
